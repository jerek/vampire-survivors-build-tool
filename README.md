# Vampire Survivors Tools
Tools for Vampire Survivors, including a build tool which automatically saves the current build in the URL, so it can be easily shared.

Created for the Survivors by [Jerek Dain](https://twitter.com/jerekdain).

If these tools fall out of date, or you would like to add more features, please feel free to create your own fork of it and modify the code. I only ask to maintain credit for the original tool. And speaking of credit, this tool was inspired by [ArrowVulcan's build tool](https://github.com/ArrowVulcan/Vampire-Survivors).
